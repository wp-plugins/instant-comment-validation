Instant Comment Validation
==========================

Add a instant validator for WordPress comment form, instead of sending users to default error page. 

## Description

WordPress deafult comment error page sucks? Its just showing an error message like "please fill out required fields" and nothing else? Trying to get rid out of this & keep users in that page. Then “Instant Comment Validation” is for you. This plugin adds validation to the comment form. When a user submits the form and something is missing, an appropiate message is displayed and individual fields are highlighted. 

That's it, no configuration needed, just install & enjoy!
